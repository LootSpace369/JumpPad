# JumpPad
A plugin jump pad for PocketMine-MP.

`
! A plugin fast code !
if has issues, pull request for me!
`

## How to use?
- /pp 1 - set position 1
- /pp 2 - set position 2
- /setjumppad - put jump pad

## Fact
Taking 2 positions only targets distance, making me forget the code to add altitude and yaw
